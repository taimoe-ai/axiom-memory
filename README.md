# Axiom

**One memory, every AI.**

AI memory as an MCP server — one brain shared by ChatGPT,
Claude (Code / Desktop / claude.ai), Gemini CLI, and any other MCP client.

Every AI app today keeps its own siloed memory: what ChatGPT knows about you,
Claude doesn't, and none of it is yours. Axiom is a self-hosted memory server
you own — your assistants read and write the same curated facts through MCP,
and the data lives in your Postgres, exportable to plain markdown at any time.

Memories are curated facts (one per record), not conversation logs. Postgres is
the source of truth; a markdown export gives you a human-readable, git-friendly
mirror.

## Features

- **Shared across apps** — ChatGPT, claude.ai, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and any
  MCP client talk to the same memory over streamable HTTP or local stdio.
- **Curated, not logged** — `remember` stores one fact per record with
  server-side dedup screening; no conversation-log landfill.
- **Hybrid recall** — ranks on a weighted blend of lexical match (full-text +
  trigram) and pgvector semantic similarity (Gemini embeddings), decayed by
  recency. CJK-friendly and cross-lingual. Long content is truncated in
  results (`get` returns the full text); on a miss, recall returns the nearest
  index entries so the caller can re-query.
- **Typed and categorised** — each memory has a lifecycle `type` (preference,
  fact, project, state, reference, procedural) that sets how fast it decays,
  and a thematic `category` (you, people, areas, topics) to filter by. Stale
  `state` memories come back flagged so the model re-checks them.
- **Version history** — every content change and every `forget` snapshots the
  previous version, so a bad overwrite by any client is recoverable through
  `history`.
- **Provenance** — a memory is either `stated` by you or `inferred` by an AI.
  Inferred memories rank lower and come back labelled, so a guess is not
  treated as a fact about you until you confirm it.
- **Overviews** — by convention (see the client instructions), each ongoing
  project keeps one `<project>-overview` memory and you keep one
  `user-profile`, so "where does X stand" and "who am I talking to" are one
  read instead of a pile of fragments.
- **Episodic layer** — `log_event` captures cheap one-line ambient signals that
  never enter recall; `review` clusters recent events and surfaces recurring
  patterns as candidates for promotion to a real memory, alongside
  near-duplicates, stale state, and barely-used memories.
- **Measurable** — `axiom eval` scores recall (hit@k, MRR) against your own
  labelled queries, so ranking changes are tested instead of guessed.
- **Graceful degradation** — no Gemini key, or the embedding API is slow?
  Recall falls back to lexical-only and nothing breaks.
- **Your data, portable** — `axiom export` dumps everything to markdown for a
  git-friendly mirror; `scripts/backup.sh` takes nightly database dumps,
  optionally copied to Cloud Storage.
- **Real auth** — Google OAuth (with Dynamic Client Registration for
  ChatGPT/claude.ai connectors) plus a static service token for headless
  callers, coexisting on the same endpoint.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code / Gemini CLI / any MCP client
        │  streamable HTTP, Authorization: Bearer <token>
        ▼
   axiom MCP server  (FastMCP)
        │
        ▼
   PostgreSQL  ──►  markdown export (git mirror), nightly pg_dump
   (hybrid recall: FTS + trigram + pgvector semantic
    similarity via Gemini embeddings, decayed by recency)
```

MCP tools: `remember`, `recall`, `get`, `forget`, `history`, `list_memories`,
`log_event`, `review`.
CLI: `axiom serve`, `axiom migrate`, `axiom export`, `axiom embed`,
`axiom review`, `axiom eval`.

## Quick start

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Docker.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/taimoe-ai/axiom-memory && cd axiom-memory
docker compose up -d          # local Postgres (pgvector)
cp .env.example .env
uv run axiom serve            # stdio MCP server (migrations run on first call)
```

Register with Claude Code (local stdio, no auth needed):

```sh
claude mcp add axiom -- uv --directory /path/to/axiom-memory run axiom serve
```

Then paste [instructions/USAGE.md](instructions/USAGE.md) into each client's
system prompt / custom instructions so models know when to call the tools.

## Connecting clients to a deployed server

Point Claude Code at the HTTP server — it detects the OAuth flow and opens a
browser to log in with Google:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http axiom https://axiom.example.com/mcp
```

ChatGPT: Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector →
`https://axiom.example.com/mcp` (it discovers OAuth and walks through the
Google login). claude.ai: Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector, same
URL.

Headless scripts (curl, CI, cron) skip OAuth with the service token:

```sh
curl -s https://axiom.example.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AXIOM_SERVICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

## Self-hosting

Runs the app and Postgres together on one box over the compose network:

```sh
cp .env.example .env    # fill in the variables below
docker compose --profile full up -d --build
```

The app serves streamable HTTP on `$PORT` (8080) at `/mcp`. Memory access is
stateless, but the OAuth proxy keeps client registrations and encrypted
upstream tokens in a named volume (`oauth_state`) so restarts don't force
ChatGPT/Claude to re-authenticate.

The OAuth flow needs a public HTTPS endpoint (e.g. a Cloudflare Tunnel) that
forwards `/.well-known/*`, `/authorize`, `/token`, `/register` and
`/auth/callback` in addition to `/mcp`.

### Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AXIOM_DATABASE_URL` | Postgres DSN (compose wires this up for you) |
| `AXIOM_BASE_URL` | Public origin the OAuth endpoints are served from |
| `AXIOM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `AXIOM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth web app, redirect URI `<base_url>/auth/callback` |
| `AXIOM_ALLOWED_EMAILS` | Comma-separated allowlist for Google login |
| `AXIOM_SERVICE_TOKEN` | Static bearer token for headless callers |
| `AXIOM_GEMINI_API_KEY` | Enables semantic recall (768-dim Gemini embeddings); empty = lexical-only |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database password (compose) |
| `AXIOM_BACKUP_GCS_URI` / `AXIOM_BACKUP_GCS_CREDENTIALS` | Optional off-machine copy of each backup (see Backups) |

All three OAuth variables must be set together; leave them empty for local
stdio use, which needs no auth at all. After enabling `AXIOM_GEMINI_API_KEY`
on an existing database, run `axiom embed` once to backfill vectors.

Ranking and review thresholds (lexical/semantic weights, decay half-lives,
truncation length, and so on) have defaults in `src/axiom/config.py`; each can
be overridden with an `AXIOM_`-prefixed environment variable.

### Backups

Memories live in a named Docker volume, so they survive restarts and
redeploys — but not `docker compose down -v` or a dead disk.
`scripts/backup.sh` dumps the database with `pg_dump` and keeps the last 14
days; run it nightly from root's crontab:

```sh
30 3 * * * /path/to/axiom-memory/scripts/backup.sh >> /var/log/axiom-backup.log 2>&1
```

Set `AXIOM_BACKUP_GCS_URI` (e.g. `gs://your-bucket/axiom/backups`) and
`AXIOM_BACKUP_GCS_CREDENTIALS` (a service-account key file) in `.env` to also
copy each dump to Cloud Storage with `gcloud`.

## Evaluating recall

Ranking is easy to break and hard to judge by eye. `axiom eval` runs a file of
labelled queries against your store and reports hit@k and MRR, without
touching usage counters:

```sh
cp evals/recall_cases.example.toml evals/recall_cases.toml   # then edit
uv run axiom eval
```

Each case is a query plus the memory names a good recall should surface. Real
case files describe your own memories, so `evals/*.toml` is gitignored apart
from the example.

## Development

```sh
docker compose up -d          # local Postgres
uv run pytest                 # tests (uses a separate axiom_test database)
uv run axiom serve --transport http   # http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp
uv run axiom export           # dump all memories to ./exports as markdown
```

Auth internals are documented in `src/axiom/auth.py`; schema lives in
`src/axiom/migrations/`.

## Status

Personal project, actively used daily by its author. Issues and PRs are
welcome, but no support or stability guarantees yet — the MCP tool surface may
still change.
